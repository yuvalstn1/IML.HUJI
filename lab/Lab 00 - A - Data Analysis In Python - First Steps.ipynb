    "Machine learning and data analysis (that is usually also a pre-step for learning) deal with data. Thererefore we need tools to manipulate it and extract the information we want. In the Python environment there are two very useful packages for this: [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/1.19/) and [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html#api).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will take the first steps into using these packages and see some of their functionalities. These will be needed throughout the course. Both packages contain many useful functionalities, of which we will introduce only a few. To find out more about the other functionalities, the documentations, **Google** and **StackOverflow** are your best friends. "

    "A great strength of `numpy` is the ease in subsetting an array to retrieve only specific parts of it. We do so by indexing and slicing the arrays. For 1D arrays these operations are very similar to those over lists.  For arrays of higher dimensions, we use a comma to separate the slicing of each dimension. For example, accessing an element in the array `arr` in the first row and second column is done by: `arr[0, 1]` (recall indexing in python begins from zero). To select only the second column, over all rows write: `arr[:, 2]`"
